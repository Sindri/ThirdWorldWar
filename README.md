Alright, so, this is what I'm looking for:

A game that can run on WinXP-Win10(can forget Win8 compatibility) not many Gamers liked 8, and I never touched it myself

Video Card, eh, don't need it to be too fancy, the fancier it's made, the less people can enjoy, 3D program or Isometric are fine, the game will operate like Total War(except the campaign map is real time) and the battles are also realtime, you only bring what you built with you you cannot build armies mid game, but any reinforcements you sent to the fight will arrive provided the battle is still going, this example is all the way back into the game "Imperium Galactica II Alliances"

the picture you see here is of the Political map,
